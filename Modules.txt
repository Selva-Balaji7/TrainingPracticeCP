Modules:
  ->JavaScript modules allows you to break up your code into separate files.
  ->We can import and export the variables,functions, or classes from one file to another
  ->ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.

 Export:
 There are two types of exports: Named and Default. 
 Named Exports:
 ->You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.
 ExampleGet your own React.js Server
  In-line individually:

  NamedExport.js

  export const name="selva";
  export const years=22; 

  All at once at the bottom:

  NamedExport.js

  const name = "Jesse"
  const age = 40

  export { name, age }


  Default Export:
    ->You can only have one default export in a file.
  Eg:
     const message = () => {
  const name = "Jesse";
  const age = 40;
  return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
  };

  export default message;

  Imports:

  ->Named exports must be destructured using curly braces. Default exports do not.
   Import named exports from the file person.js:
   import { name, age } from "./person.js";

   Import a default export from the file message.js:
   import message from "./message.js";
   Note: Default export name can be varied.
