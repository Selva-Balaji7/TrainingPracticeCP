Hoc(higher order Component):

* To share same business logic with multiple components, we use HOC.
* Here we share business logic from function component to other Components.

eg: In wrapper component, we need to import hoc component
    import MyHocComp from "./MyHocComp";
    export default MyHocComp(ClickCounterComp);

wrapper Component:
	*A Wrapper Component (or Wrapped Component) is a normal React component that gets wrapped inside a Higher-Order Component (HOC). The HOC adds extra functionality to it.
	*WrapperComp is a component that you pass as an argument to your HOC (MyHocComp).

which component we should import in app.js?
 * Since you're exporting the HOC-enhanced version of ClickCounterComp directly from ClickCounterComp.js, you should import it directly in App.js.

Why import ClickCounterComp?

 *Even though ClickCounterComp is a normal class component, you wrapped it with MyHocComp before exporting.
So, ClickCounterComp already includes the HOC logic when you import it.
Why not import MyHocComp separately?

 *You donâ€™t need to import MyHocComp in App.js because you already used it while exporting ClickCounterComp.
