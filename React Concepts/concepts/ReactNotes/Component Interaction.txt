Component Interaction:

* Passing data from  parent component to child.
* We can pass "state" and "Functions" as props
* while performing component interaction in between component they must have child relation.

How to establish parent child relation in between component?
step-1: first we have to import child component in parent component.
step-2: write child component name as tag in parent component.

syntax: <childcomp name={empName} changename={this.changename}/>

Pure-Component:

 *  It is used to prevent unnecessary re-rendering component by performing shallow comparison
 *  Achieved by extending class with PureComponent class.
  
  import React, { PureComponent } from "react";
  class MyPureComp extends PureComponent

React.Memo():

 *It is used to prevent unnecessary re-rendering function component by performing shallow comparison.
 *To achieve, we have to pass function component names as an argument to React.memo()

Syntax:  export default React.memo(MyMemoComp);
