          The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983
          for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the
          universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is
          regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a
          symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction
          and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was
          declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.

        <h3 id="con-2">History</h3>
        <p> December 1652, Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb wrote a letter to his father 
          about the tomb, the mosque and the assembly hall of the complex developing 
          extensive leaks during the previous rainy season.[53] In 1658, Shah Jahan
           was deposed by Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort
            from where he could see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan's death in 1666, Aurangzeb
             buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[54] In the 18th century, the Jat 
             rulers of Bharatpur attacked the Taj Mahal while invading Agra and took away two chandeliers,
              one of agate and another of silver, which had hung over the main cenotaph and the gold and silver screen.
               Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at 
               the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.</p>
      </section>
      <h3 id="con-3">Inspiration</h3>
      <p>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal,
         who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[10][11] Construction started in 1632, 
         and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.</p>
      <h3 id="con-4">Architecture</h3>
       <p>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture.[16] Inspirations for the
         building came from Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty)
          and Humayun's Tomb in Delhi which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht plan of the site.[17][18] The building complex employs symmetrical
           constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols.[16] While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones,
            red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time.[19] The entire complex sits on platform
             measuring 300 metres (980 ft) in length and 8.7 metres (28.5 ft) in height on the banks of Yamuna river. The platform is built with varying patterns 
             of dark and light colored sandstone</p>

        <h2 class="title">chichen Itza</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
          <img class="img" src="../assets/images/chichen_Itza.jpg" alt="chichen_Itza" />
         
        <p>
          Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
        </p>
        <h3 id="chich-2">History</h3>
        <p> The layout of Chichén Itzá site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD.[19] Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula.[20] The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998</p>
      </section>
      <h3 id="chich-3">Politicalorganization</h3>
      <p>Several archeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichén Itzá may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a "multepal" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.[14]

        This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the "multepal" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico</p>
      <h3 id="chich-4">Economy</h3>
       <p>hichén Itzá was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee.[16] Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast,[17] Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America.[citation needed]

        Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichén Itzá expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port</p>

        <h2 class="title">Great wall of china</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
          <img class="img" src="../assets/images/great_wall.jpg" alt="great_wall" />
         
        <p>
          the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

          Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
        </p>
        <h3 id="great-2">History</h3>
        <p> Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands[26] of workers died building the Qin wall. Later, the Han,[27] the Northern dynasties and the Sui all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders.[28] The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region.[28] Dynasties founded by non-Han ethnic groups also built their border walls: the Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei, the Khitan-ruled Liao, Jurchen-led Jin and the Tangut-established Western Xia, who ruled vast territories over Northern China throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls but those were located much to the north of the other Great Walls as we know it, within China's autonomous region of Inner Mongolia and in modern-day Mongolia itself.</p>

      <h3 id="great-3">Course</h3>
      <p>In 2012, based on existing research and the results of a comprehensive mapping survey, the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China concluded that the remaining Great Wall associated sites include 10,051 wall sections, 1,764 ramparts or trenches, 29,510 individual buildings, and 2,211 fortifications or passes, with the walls and trenches spanning a total length of 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi).[3] Incorporating advanced technologies, the study has concluded that the Ming Great Wall measures 8,850 km (5,500 mi).[52] This consists of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) of wall sections, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.[52] In addition, Qin, Han and earlier Great Wall sites are 3,080 km (1,914 mi) long in total; Jin dynasty (1115–1234) border fortifications are 4,010 km (2,492 mi) in length; the remainder date back to Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui, Tang, the Five Dynasties, Song, Liao and Xixia.[3] About half of the sites are located in Inner Mongolia (31%) and Hebei (19%).</p>
      <h3 id="great-4">Visibility</h3>
       <p>One of the earliest known references to the myth that the Great Wall can be seen from the moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, "This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon."[74] The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895 where he states "besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon."[75] The issue of "canals" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the moon also appears in 1932's Ripley's Believe It or Not! strip</p>
